        The world is relying more and more on plastics. As evident in this graph, we can see an exponential 
        increase in the amount of plastics produced, this can mean drastic impacts on the environment and the 
        health of people as well. This sudden increase in plastics over the last 50 years has played a dramatic 
        role in human health, with the introduction of BPA free products, studies showed that the toxic effects 
        were minimised but not completely eradicated. <br> <br>Studies in 2015 have shown that the increased use 
        of plastics in our kitchens and general life have contributed to the consumption of up to 5 grams of micro 
        plastics a week, which is the equivalent of a credit card a week. The consumed micro plastics have negative 
        effects in the long term, which includes the gradual decrease in male reproduction and sperm quality, making 
        them a potential hazard to reproductive success. This decrease in male reproduction directly correlates with 
        the graph of the global plastics production. <br> <br>

        What are Micro-Plastics?
      </h3>
      <p id="p2">
        Microplastics are plastic debris pieces that are smaller than five millimeters in size. 
        They can be found in most habitats on Earth as well as in the digestive tracts of many 
        marine organisms and sea birds. 
        This is alarming us to take action.

        The map below shows the amount of micro-plastics found within this area, over the years.

          Comparing plastic waste per capita (kg/person/day) is a better way to distinguish which countries are doing the most damage.
          When comparing the percentage of plastic waste by country, the country's size and population often impacts its wastage. 
          A larger country might have more plastic waste but their per capita waste is more fair.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Countries with the highest plastic waste per capita</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
          Kuwait, Antigua & Barbuda and Saint Kitts & Nevis are some of the worst plastic producers 
          on the planet when population and size are taken out of the equation. The graph also seams 
          to taper off and steadies it self the further it goes, meaning that most of those countries 
          produce around the same amount of waste per capita.

        India has one of the largest percentage of plastic waste in the world but it has the lowest plastic waste per capita (kg/person/day).
        This shows that the plastic waste per capita (kg/person/day) is a better way to see which countries need to make a change.
        Most of these countries are doing something, we should learn from them. <br>
